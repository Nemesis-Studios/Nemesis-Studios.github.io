#### Features W.I.P

- Basic Bullet System 

This shouldn't be that difficult to implement,  the biggest things currently being considered is design related,  how to handle stats on weapons vs projectiles 

- Basic Damage System 

This ties into the bullet system for the most part, but there are a few extra points of clarity here that need to be addressed 
mostly in the replication area.

- Basic Score System

Im not yet sure how i want score / objectives to work,  the system i had in mind for alpha was just simply a 1:1  one point per damage dealt. 

- Basic Loot System 

This one is up for debate,  i dont know how this should be implemented yet or if it should be at all,  everybody overdoes loot chests *cough cough*  but its the only thing that seems to come to mind. 

#### Features Testing 

- ENet Multiplayer (Basic)

This may need some reworking, need to figure out the best way to seperate the server logic from the client logic scene trees will become a problem.  

- Character Controller 

Currently the controller works,  along with very basic aninimations 

- Basic Animations

I'm still debating on the art style so i don't want to get too deep into custom animations Miximo is a good placeholder
